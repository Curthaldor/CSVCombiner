# Sample Data

This folder contains example CSV files demonstrating the types of data that can be processed by the CSV Combiner script.

## Files Description

The sample files appear to be mining equipment log data with timestamps as filenames, showing how the script handles:

- Multiple CSV files with identical structure
- Timestamp-based file naming conventions
- Real-world data volumes and formats

## Usage

You can use these files to test the CSV Combiner functionality:

1. Copy desired files to your configured input folder
2. Run the CSV merger script
3. Check the output folder for the combined results

## File Format

The sample CSV files follow a consistent structure that's ideal for combination, with:
- Common header rows across all files
- Compatible data types and column structures
- Timestamp-based naming for easy identification

This demonstrates the script's ability to handle real-world data scenarios where multiple data collection sessions or time periods need to be consolidated.
